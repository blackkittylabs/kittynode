## Development

- We use [just](https://github.com/casey/just) for development tasks.
- For development speed we only release for aarch64-apple-darwin. But kittynode is cross-platform.
- For local signing use the key `tauri.conf.json` > `bundle` > `macOS` > `signingIdentity` with `security find-identity -v -p codesigning`. The value in `()` is fine.

## Releases

Release branches are (currently) manually created from the `main` branch, and are named `release/vX.Y.Z`. It includes version bumps and a changelog generated by `git-cliff`. After merging the release branch, we create a git tag for that commit. This triggers the `cargo-dist` workflow which handles the actual release.
