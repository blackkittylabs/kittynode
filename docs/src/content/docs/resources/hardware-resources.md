## Hardware options

### NanoPC-T6 (ARM) 

- $160: NanoPC-T6 16GB RAM
- $300: SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 4TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD
- $10: Generic power supply, ethernet cable (optional)

This brings the cost to about $470.

### Minisforum UM890 Pro

- $480: Minisforum UM890 Pro
- $300: SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 4TB PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD
- $50: 32GB of RAM

This brings the cost to about $830.

### Minisforum MS-A1

- Marketed more towards desktop users as opposed to homelabbers.

## Key points

- Extensibility for storage would be nice (but consider EIP-4444).
- Storage is replaceable, but RAM is not (in some cases).
- 64GB of RAM seems enough for most people (can run lots of things).
- Ideally the device can be upgraded to meet changing demands.
- No one size fits all.
