We are building Kittynode because we believe that the digital world ought to be governed by the constituents of its users (human and machine). This means that the users must engage in voting and consensus to make decisions about the digital world.

Kittynode is focused on enabling the populace of the digital world (humans and machines) to engage in shaping the world they participate in through voting and consensus. It also enables participants to enter and exit worlds through their vote.

Kittynode is building for the present moment, but recognizing that the future will be different. This means that Kittynode will have a v1, with the expectation that like all great software, it will evolve over time as we learn more and adapt to changing technology.

Here is a running list of how the world could change over the next 100 years. We will call this section the internet stack of the future, it is a working document area.

## The internet stack of the future

1. Local WiFi routers and local modems no longer exist, and internet is provided via space satellites and terrestrial towers.
2. Internet is always on and you are always connected (99.999% or higher).
3. Data bandwidth could exceed 100 Gbps, and latency could be under 1 ms.
4. Centralized root name servers are replaced by decentralized DNS.

## Mission and values

Mission ideas:

- To enable the populace of the digital world to engage in shaping the world they participate in through voting and consensus.
- To protect the world computer.
- To empower users to run decentralized infrastructure.

Kittynode is built for users.
