Kittynode is open to everyone, and happily welcomes any contributions!

## Working with the codebase

Get started with the codebase and running development commands.

### Prerequisites

<Steps>

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install):

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

2. Install [just](https://github.com/casey/just):

    ```bash
    cargo install just
    ```

3. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

4. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).

</Steps>

### Development commands

<Steps>

1. Clone the repo and change into the directory:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:kittynode/kittynode.git && cd kittynode
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3. Install Rust dev tools:

    ```bash
    just install-dev-tools
    ```

4. See the full list of commands:

    ```bash
    just -l
    ```

</Steps>

## Releases

We push a tag `<package-name>-canary.n` to GitHub, and CI will build and publish a draft release for the package. We auto-generate a changelog with GitHub, and publish a latest release (this gives us links to refer to the latest release).

You can find all the latest releases [here](https://github.com/kittynode/kittynode/releases).

We will support package-level changelogs and semantic versioning in the future, but during the rapid development phase we don't want to waste time on that.

## Deploying to iOS

Some notes until we get it resolved upstream in Tauri:

1. Make sure the physical device is properly connected and xcode is open.
2. Make sure any last build is uninstalled from the device.
3. See the justfile for more clean up commands.
4. If you don't see the iOS IP, then it's a connection issue.
