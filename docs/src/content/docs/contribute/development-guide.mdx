## Working with the codebase

Get started with the codebase and running development commands.

### Prerequisites

<Steps>

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/):

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

2. Install [just](https://github.com/casey/just):

    cargo install just
    ```

3. Install [bun](https://bun.sh/):

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
    ```

</Steps>

### Development commands

<Steps>

1. Clone the repo and change into the directory:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:kittynode/kittynode.git && cd kittynode
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

## Releases

We push a tag `<package-name>-canary.n` to GitHub, and CI will build and publish a draft release for the package. We auto-generate a changelog with GitHub, and publish a pre-release.

You can find all the latest releases [here](https://github.com/kittynode/kittynode/releases).

We will support package-level changelogs and semantic versioning in the future, but during the rapid development phase we don't want to waste time on that.
