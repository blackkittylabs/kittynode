description: Questions about Kittynode's design.

This page is a collection of questions we have about Kittynode. We are building and thinking out loud here.

### Should every internet connected device run an Ethereum node?

To have trustless access to the internet, it will be necessary unless they are bootstrapping with weak subjectivity endpoints.

Another question is whether you personally should run multiple nodes or a single node. It seems a bit useless to run multiple validating nodes.

### Should voting in consensus require self-operation of a node, or can that part be delegated?

Current answer: We think that self-operation of a node is something the free market will seek to replace, and some trustless mechanism with liquid staking could be important.

### Do machines have the same voting rights as humans; and if so, does it open additional attack vectors?

Current answer: Yes.

### What are all the parts of the decentralized internet stack?

Outside of Ethereum, what are other parts of the "stack"? Can we list out the core parts (ENS, IPFS, etc.)? This can be important for understanding who is running what.
