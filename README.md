# stn

A command line tool for managing Taiko nodes.

# Installation

Head over to releases for a copy paste install command.

# Usage

Execute `stn help` for the full list of commands.

# Roadmap

Some cool stuff planned ahead:

- Adding support for a "setup wizard" / "config" command
- Managing node configs somewhere in ~/.stn/config (even aliasing eth-docker and managing those nodes, making stn something like a kubectl)
- Adding support for Taiko proposers / provers
- Adding support for other L2 nodes

If you have some other cool ideas feel free to open an issue! ヽ(・∀・)ﾉ
